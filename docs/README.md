# Requirements

* Microsoft Excel 2010+ for Windows.

# Installation instructions

1. Add the project site from which the ClickOnce solution is served (i.e., [https://karlhammar.com/ExcelRDF/distribution/](https://karlhammar.com/ExcelRDF/distribution/) to your your Trusted Sites list in the Control Panel. This is required as I do not have a for-pay code-signing certificate.
2. Download and execute setup.exe from the [releases page](https://github.com/hammar/ExcelRDF/releases).
3. There is no step 3.

# Usage instructions

TBD.
